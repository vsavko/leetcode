/*Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
Example:
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.*/ 
class Solution {
    public static int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        HashMap<Integer,Integer> hm = new HashMap<>();     
        for(int i = 0; i < citations.length; i++){
            if(!hm.containsKey(citations[i]))
                hm.put(citations[i],0);
            hm.put(citations[i], hm.get(citations[i]) + 1);
        }
        
        int i = 0;
        Integer [] range = new Integer [hm.size()];
        for(Integer key: hm.keySet()) {
            range[i] = key;
            i++;
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(range, Collections.reverseOrder());
        
        int currentMAx = 0;
        for(Integer key: range) {
            if(currentMAx >= key) break;
            currentMAx += hm.get(key);
            if(currentMAx >= key) {
                currentMAx = key;
                break;
            }
        }
